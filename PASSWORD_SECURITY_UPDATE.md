# Password Security Update

## Overview

This update implements secure password encryption across the EVSU Voice platform, replacing the previous plain text password storage with industry-standard encryption using PHP's built-in `password_hash()` and `password_verify()` functions.

## Security Improvements

### 1. Password Encryption

- **Before**: Passwords were stored in plain text in the database
- **After**: Passwords are encrypted using PHP's `PASSWORD_DEFAULT` algorithm (currently bcrypt)
- **Benefits**:
  - Passwords cannot be read if database is compromised
  - Each password has a unique salt
  - Resistant to rainbow table attacks

### 2. Secure Password Verification

- Uses `password_verify()` function for authentication
- Constant-time comparison prevents timing attacks
- Automatic handling of salt and hash verification

## Updated Features

### 1. User Registration (`login.php`)

- New user passwords are automatically encrypted before storage
- Validation remains the same (minimum 6 characters)
- Registration process is transparent to users

### 2. User Login (`login.php` + `includes/auth.php`)

- Login process now uses secure password verification
- Maintains session management functionality
- No changes to user experience

### 3. Admin Password Change (`change-password.php`)

- Admins can change their own passwords securely
- Requires current password verification
- New password is encrypted before storage

### 4. User Management (`admin/manage-users.php`)

- **NEW**: Admin interface to manage all users
- **NEW**: Admin can change any user's password
- User statistics and role management
- Responsive design with modal dialogs

## Files Modified

### Core Authentication

- `includes/auth.php` - Updated login, register, and added password change methods
- `change-password.php` - Updated to use secure password change method

### Admin Interface

- `admin/manage-users.php` - **NEW** - User management interface
- `includes/header.php` - Added "Manage Users" navigation for admins

### Migration

- `migrate-passwords.php` - **NEW** - Script to convert existing passwords
- `PASSWORD_SECURITY_UPDATE.md` - **NEW** - This documentation

## Migration Instructions

### For Existing Installations

1. **Backup your database** before proceeding
2. Run the migration script to convert existing passwords:
   ```bash
   php migrate-passwords.php
   ```
3. Verify the migration was successful
4. **Delete the migration script** for security:
   ```bash
   rm migrate-passwords.php
   ```

### For New Installations

- No migration needed
- All new registrations will automatically use encrypted passwords

## Admin Features

### User Management Interface

Access: Admin Dashboard â†’ Manage Users

Features:

- View all registered users
- User statistics (total users, admins, students)
- Change user passwords (admin privilege)
- Responsive table design

### Password Change Modal

- Secure form with validation
- Password confirmation requirement
- Real-time validation feedback
- Minimum 6 character requirement

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Strong Hashing**: Uses bcrypt with automatic salt generation
2. **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all password fields
3. **Access Control**: Admin-only functions properly protected
4. **CSRF Protection**: Forms use POST methods with proper validation
5. **Password Requirements**: Minimum length and confirmation matching

## Technical Details

### Password Hashing

```php
// Registration/Password Change
$hashed_password = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);

// Login Verification
if (password_verify($password, $stored_hash)) {
    // Login successful
}
```

### Database Changes

- No schema changes required
- Password field stores 60-character bcrypt hashes
- Existing VARCHAR(255) fields are sufficient

### Security Headers

- Passwords are never logged or displayed
- Form data is properly sanitized
- Session management remains secure

## Browser Compatibility

The updated interface is compatible with:

- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Migration fails**

   - Check database connection
   - Ensure proper permissions
   - Verify PHP version (7.0+ required for password_hash)

2. **Users can't login after migration**

   - Ensure migration script completed successfully
   - Check for any users with empty passwords
   - Verify database connection in auth.php

3. **Admin can't access user management**
   - Verify admin role in database
   - Check file permissions on admin/manage-users.php
   - Ensure proper session management

### Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the migration summary output
2. Verify database connectivity
3. Ensure all files have proper permissions
4. Check PHP error logs for detailed error messages

## Security Notes

- **Never** store passwords in plain text again
- The migration script should be deleted after use
- Regularly update PHP to maintain security patches
- Consider implementing additional security measures like 2FA in the future

## Version Information

- **Update Date**: December 2024
- **PHP Version Required**: 7.0+
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (existing schema compatible)
- **Framework**: Native PHP with custom authentication

---

**Important**: This update significantly improves the security of the EVSU Voice platform. All existing users will need to use their current passwords for the first login after migration, after which their passwords will be securely encrypted.
