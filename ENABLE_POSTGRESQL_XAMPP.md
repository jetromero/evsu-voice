# Enable PostgreSQL Support in XAMPP

## Current Status:

- ✅ PHP is working
- ✅ `php_pgsql.dll` exists in `C:\xampp\php\ext\`
- ❌ `php_pdo_pgsql.dll` is missing
- ❌ Extensions not enabled in php.ini

## Solution 1: Manual Configuration (Recommended)

### Step 1: Edit php.ini

1. Open `C:\xampp\php\php.ini` with a text editor (like Notepad++)
2. Find the section with extensions (around line 900-1000), look for lines like:
   ```
   ;extension=bz2
   ;extension=curl
   ;extension=fileinfo
   ```
3. Add these lines in the extensions section:
   ```
   extension=pgsql
   extension=pdo_pgsql
   ```

### Step 2: Download Missing DLL (if needed)

Since `php_pdo_pgsql.dll` might be missing, you may need to download it:

1. Go to https://windows.php.net/downloads/
2. Find your PHP version (check with `php -v`)
3. Download the corresponding "Non-Thread Safe" ZIP file
4. Extract `php_pdo_pgsql.dll` from the `ext` folder
5. Copy it to `C:\xampp\php\ext\`

### Step 3: Restart Apache

1. Open XAMPP Control Panel
2. Stop Apache
3. Start Apache again

### Step 4: Verify Installation

Run: `php check_php_extensions.php`

## Solution 2: Alternative Database Options

If PostgreSQL setup is problematic, you have these alternatives:

### Option A: Use MySQL with Supabase

Supabase supports connection pooling that can work with MySQL applications via PgBouncer, but this requires configuration changes.

### Option B: Use PlanetScale (MySQL-compatible)

PlanetScale is a MySQL-compatible serverless database:

1. Sign up at https://planetscale.com
2. Create a database
3. Keep your existing MySQL code
4. Get better scaling and features

### Option C: Use Railway PostgreSQL

Railway offers simple PostgreSQL hosting:

1. Sign up at https://railway.app
2. Deploy PostgreSQL
3. Use the same schema and connection code

## Solution 3: Quick Test Alternative

For immediate testing, let's create a simplified connection test:

### Create a temporary MySQL test:

If you want to verify everything else works, temporarily switch back to MySQL:

```php
// In config/database.php - temporary MySQL test
$this->conn = new PDO("mysql:host=localhost;dbname=test", "root", "");
```

## Recommended Next Steps:

1. **Try Solution 1** (add extensions to php.ini)
2. **If that fails**, try **Solution 2B** (PlanetScale) for immediate results
3. **For production**, stick with Supabase once PostgreSQL is working

## Need Help?

If you're having trouble:

1. Check your PHP version: `php -v`
2. Verify XAMPP version
3. Consider updating XAMPP to latest version
4. Or use a different local development environment like Laragon

**Note:** The PostgreSQL migration offers significant benefits, but MySQL alternatives can work too if you encounter setup issues.
